# Object Detection Using YOLOv8n

This repository contains a project for detecting objects using the **YOLOv8n** (Nano version of YOLOv8) model. The project specifically focuses on detecting **persons in a cricket match video** and detecting a **flying airplane**.

## Overview

Object detection is a key task in computer vision. Using **YOLOv8n**, a state-of-the-art object detection model, this project successfully identifies:

- **Persons in a cricket match video**

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of YOLOv8n in real-world scenarios, such as sports events and outdoor activities.

## Features

- **YOLOv8n**: A lightweight version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, optimized for fast inference on limited hardware.
- **Person Detection in a Cricket Match**: Detects multiple persons on the cricket field.
- **Airplane Detection**: Detects an airplane in flight.
- **Real-time or Batch Processing**: Can process videos either in real-time or in batch mode for pre-recorded videos.
